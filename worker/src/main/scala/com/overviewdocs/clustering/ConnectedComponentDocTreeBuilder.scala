/**
 * ConnectedComponentDocTreeBuilder.scala
 * Document clustering algorithm based on connected components
 * Original algorithm by Stephen Ingram
 * Also, a Hybrid k-means/connected components algorithm
 *
 * This is no longer the mainline algorithm for visual exploration of the documents
 * as it produces too much "dust." Recursive k-means is superior.

 * Overview, created July 2012
