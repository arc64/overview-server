/** A stupid wrapper around java.util.InetAddress, for Squeryl.

  *
  * In brief: InetAddress is a parent class; any sample value will be of a more
  * specific class. That means Squeryl can't register a NonPrimitiveJdbcMapper
  * for the generic type. This class gets around it by being a specific type.
  *
  * It isn't all that painful. We just need to wrap all the functionality from
  * java.net.InetAddress that we will ever use. Luckily, that isn't much (yet).
