/** Opens a reader and writer to a tempfile that has no filename.
  *
  * Upon construction, java.io.File.createTempFile() will be called, a
  * java.io.FileInputStream and java.io.FileOutputStream will be opened on the
  * result, and the file will be deleted. The operating system will
  * garbage-collect the tempfile when all references to it are deleted--that is,
  * when the streams are closed.
  *
  * To reclaim the disk space, do one of the following:
  *
  * 1. Call inputStream.close and outputStream.close
  * 2. Let the TempFile fall out of scope, so the JVM closes the streams; or
  * 3. End the JVM unexpectedly, so the operating system cleans things up
  *
  * Expected usage:
  *
  *   val tempfile = new TempFile
  *   tempfile.outputStream.write("Hello!".toByteArray)
  *   tempfile.outputStream.close
  *   tempfile.inputStream.read // returns 'H'
  *   tempfile.inputStream.close // reclaims disk space
